### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adani :)

Iâ€™m a Cognitive Science researcher and Ph.D. student at Stanford University, where Iâ€™m advised by the wonderful [Prof. Hyo Gweon](http://sll.stanford.edu/)! I'm broadly interested in how our minds ðŸ’­ and brains ðŸ§  operate, learn, and develop throughout early childhood!
