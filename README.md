### Hi there! 👋 I'm Adani :)

I’m a **Ph.D. student** at Stanford University, where I’m advised by the wonderful [Prof. Hyo Gweon](http://sll.stanford.edu/)!

I’m **interested in (modeling) children’s developing minds**, particularly the processes and cognitive mechanisms by which they seek and construct an understanding of both the external world and their inner world in interaction with other people! You can find more details on my [personal website](https://www.adaniabutto.com/)!
