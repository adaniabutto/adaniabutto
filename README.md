### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adani :)

Iâ€™m a **Ph.D. student** at Stanford University, where Iâ€™m advised by the wonderful [Prof. Hyo Gweon](http://sll.stanford.edu/)!

Iâ€™m **interested in (modeling) childrenâ€™s developing minds**, particularly the processes and cognitive mechanisms by which they construct an understanding of the physical world around them, and a conception of _themselves_ as agents in that world! You can find more details on my [personal website](https://www.adaniabutto.com/)!
