### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adani :)

Iâ€™m an incoming **Ph.D. student** at Stanford University, where Iâ€™m advised by the wonderful [Prof. Hyo Gweon](http://sll.stanford.edu/)! I was born and raised in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and completed my undergraduate studies there.

Iâ€™m **interested in childrenâ€™s developing minds**, particularly the processes and cognitive mechanisms by which they seek and construct an understanding of both the external world and their inner world in interaction with other people! You can find more details on my [personal website](https://www.adaniabutto.com/)!
