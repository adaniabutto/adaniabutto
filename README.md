### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adani :)

Iâ€™m a **Ph.D. student** at Stanford University, where Iâ€™m advised by the wonderful [Prof. Hyo Gweon](http://sll.stanford.edu/)!

Iâ€™m broadly interested in the interplay between how humans make sense of the physical world and how they make sense of themselves as agents within that world! You can find more details on my [personal website](https://www.adaniabutto.com/)!
